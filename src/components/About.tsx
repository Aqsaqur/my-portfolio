      I am a passionate and curious learner currently diving deep into Python programming. My interests lie in blending technology with creativity, particularly through building robots with Arduino. Although I'm still a beginner in robotics, I love exploring how hardware and software interact. I'm excited about advancing my skills, especially in artificial intelligence and machine learning, where I see immense potential for innovation. With a strong desire to learn and grow, I am constantly working to expand my technical knowledge and turn my ideas into reality.
